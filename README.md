# 3D-rendering
A basic Cube

A simple 3D engine I made using Python and Matplotlib! It renders a 3D cube from scratch doing all the math without any 3D libraries like OpenGL or DirectX.

## Controls

Use the keyboard to rotate the cube!

- **W**: Rotate Up
- **S**: Rotate Down
- **A**: Rotate Left
- **D**: Rotate Right

_(Make sure you click on the plot window first so the keys actually register!)_

## How to run

First you need to install the libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Then just run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```
